This is a minimalist app that uses the fuse module for fuzzy search of data in a mongodb collection. This app uses a database, Books and a collection inventory. A user can search within a search bar and the data will be queried from the inventory collection and the information will be printed in console. 

Next steps for this app will be to print the results to another view.
